  <p class="bodytext">Countless stray dogs and cats are homeless because they were given up by their owners, and only so
    many of them are rescued. Because of overpopulation, many cats and dogs are euthanized in animal shelters. </p>
  <br><br>
  <p class="bodytext">Currently, only 10% of dogs and 15% of cats are euthanized in Canada. While this may seem like a
    small percentage, we can do a lot better if everyone adopts a pet in Canada. Not only that, but many countries in
    the world still have many shelter pets euthanized. By adopting an animal, you are saving their lives by providing a
    home and family. </p>
  <br><br><br>
  <h2>Support Your Local Animal Shelter</h2>
  <br>
  <p class="bodytext">By adopting an animal from your local animal shelters, you are supporting and recognizing their
    hard work. The more animals are adopted from their shelters, the more space they have to bring in more animals that
    are in need of rescue.</p>
  <br><Br>
  <p class="bodytext"> While not all breeders are bad, there are some places that mass-breed cats and dogs, known as
    puppy mills and kitten mills. These places are not ethical since the animals are kept in cages that are poorly
    conditioned. The animals there are not medically taken properly, and they are often in poor health. Adoption is much
    more preferred if you want a pet, because you are fighting against the animal cruelty of these mills.</p>
